# React 103

So it can be confusing working with state in React, also handlers and the constructor and the bind method can be challenging.

Lets look at React another way.

React/Redux

* functions
* props
* higher order functions
* reducer
* Provider
* connect

```
import React from 'react'

const App = function () {
  return (
    <div>My App Here</div>
  )
}

export default App
```
